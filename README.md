# in_the_shadow (work in progress)

In this project, you will develop a game close to [Shadowmatic](http://www.shadowmatic.com/).<br/>
Here is the goal of the
game: the player must use an object in the foreground to create a shadow that looks like
a familiar shape in the background. 

The aim of this project is to make you implement a simple game from A to Z using a
game engine.<br/>
The game design is not too complex, but it requires a little creativity.

Made with [Unity](https://unity.com/fr).<br/>
Music made with the [AIVA](https://www.aiva.ai/) artificial intelligence.
